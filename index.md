I'm a Ruby Developer based in Minneapolis.

Python and Javascript aren't so bad either.

## About Me

I'm originally from Chanhassen, MN - home of the late [Prince Rogers Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) and [Eckankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckankar). I'd like to think I still turned out somewhat normal.

I currently work as a software engineer for [ReachLocal](https://www.reachlocal.com) - a digital marketing SaaS company, recently acquired by [Gannett](https://www.gannett.com/).

Prior to my time with ReachLocal, I worked as a Rails Engineer at [Apruve](https://www.apruve.com) and as a software consultant in Optum Technology's [Innovation Garage](http://www.thegarage.us).

I also teach part-time during the evenings at the University of Minnesota's [coding boot camp](https://bootcamp.umn.edu/coding/). In the immortal words of Michael Stipe, "everybody hates a sad professor" - having a passion for the subject material certainly helps with engagement.

Outside of work, I bowl in a league at [Town Hall Lanes](http://www.thlanes.com/) with some former coworkers, and dabble in tabletop tomfoolery - [Gloomhaven](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven) is my latest addiction. I never seem to tire of Seinfeld and Mystery Science Theater 3000 reruns.

I hold degrees in Chemistry and Computer Science from the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](http://twin-cities.umn.edu).

### Just Remember:

~~~bash
$ fortune -m computers
%
All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.  Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal.  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.  But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug."
