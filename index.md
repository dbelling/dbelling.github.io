I'm a software developer based in [Minneapolis, MN](https://www.minneapolismn.gov/).

## About Me

I'm originally from Chanhassen, MN - home of the late [Prince Rogers Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) and [Eckankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckankar). I'd like to think I still turned out somewhat normal.

I've worked in various engineering roles at [ForUsAll](https://www.forusall.com), [TotalExpert](https://totalexpert.com/), [Flipgrid](https://info.flipgrid.com), [Gannett](https://www.gannett.com/), [Apruve](https://www.apruve.com) and Optum Technology's [Innovation Garage](http://www.thegarage.us). I have also taught several courses at the University of Minnesota's [coding boot camp](https://bootcamp.umn.edu/coding/), and assist with various technical projects for a [local pet rescue](https://www.therescuepack.org/).

I live with my partner of many years and our wonderful dogs - a [French Bulldog](https://www.instagram.com/faechunkymonkeythefrenchie/), and a [Pug](https://www.instagram.com/vivi_the_pug/). It is said that a parent's dream is for their children to have more opportunity than they had. As my dogs now have a stronger online social presence than I do, I consider myself a fulfilled pet parent.

In "the before times", I bowled in a league at [Town Hall Lanes](http://www.thlanes.com/) with a few coworkers, and dabbled in tabletop games. We've recently completed most of the [Gloomhaven](http://www.cephalofair.com/gloomhaven) campaign, and are partially through the [Forgotten Circles](https://cephalofair.com/collections/board-games/products/gloomhaven-forgotten-circles) campaign. I also never seem to tire of [Seinfeld](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098904/) and [Mystery Science Theater 3000](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094517/) reruns, and have a soft spot for 80's college rock - especially, [R.E.M.](https://remhq.com/) and [Big Star](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123270136).

I hold degrees in Chemistry and Computer Science from the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](http://twin-cities.umn.edu).

### Just Remember:

~~~bash
$ fortune -m computers
%
All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.  Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal.  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.  But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug."
