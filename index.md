I'm a Ruby Developer based in Minneapolis.

Python and Javascript aren't so bad either.

## About Me

I'm originally from Chanhassen, MN - home of the late [Prince Rogers Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)) and [Eckankar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckankar). I'd like to think I still turned out somewhat normal.

I currently work as a software consultant in Optum Technology's [Innovation Garage](http://www.thegarage.us) alongside a team of UX/UI designers to deliver MVP health and wellness applications.

Before my time with Optum, I spent my days as a lab rat in [3M's ESPE dental division](http://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/dental-us/) and became very familiar with six sigma [design of experiments](https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/design-of-experiments-doe/design-experiments-software-testing/) and [color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space). Too much time working in yellow light and the stench of methacrylated bovine teeth finally got to me, so I cowered to the safety of software development.

Outside of work, I bowl in a league and have recently started a [Pathfinder campaign](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG) with a few friends. I never seem to tire of Seinfeld and Mystery Science Theater 3000 reruns.

I hold degrees in Chemistry and Computer Science from the [University of Minnesota, Twin Cities](http://twin-cities.umn.edu).

### Just Remember...

~~~bash
$ fortune -m computers
%
All programmers are optimists.  Perhaps this modern sorcery especially attracts those who believe in happy endings and fairy godmothers.  Perhaps the hundreds of nitty frustrations drive away all but those who habitually focus on the end goal.  Perhaps it is merely that computers are young, programmers are younger, and the young are always optimists.  But however the selection process works, the result is indisputable: "This time it will surely run," or "I just found the last bug."
