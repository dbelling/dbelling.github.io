Is it engagement and ideas? Or is it engagement versus ideas?

It’s a topic most managers want to avoid when discussing crowdsourced innovation for the first time. They will dance around it, downplay the importance and sometimes evade the subject altogether. Why? No one, no leader in particular, wants to appear to be un-innovative. So, engaging in crowdsourced innovation with the mindset that engagement and not ideas is the main objective, can be a difficult conversation.

However, it is hardly a unique conversation and it should be talked about head-on because ideas and engagement are inseparable and can work together to level-set expectations.

> “Engagement can lead to ideas and ideas can lead to more engagement. The two need to be discussed as though they represent one comprehensive philosophy about crowdsourced innovation and the forecasted outcomes of any challenge or event,” Joel Morris,  Director of ignite! Innovation, stated.

To be sure, all leaders want new, fresh ideas. Especially ideas that can cut costs, improve efficiency or revolutionize the way an industry does business. Crowdsourced innovation events can and do produce just that. But there’s a catch. Most new ideas take time, money and unknown resources to reach success. This is a scary notion for a leader who might be looking to cut costs in the first place.

But this is the wrong approach to crowdsourced innovation. Ideas should be secondary on any leader’s mind. Ideas, especially high-quality ideas, are the product of well thought-out, user-focused engagement events. Creating and enhancing the user experience enables the extraction of implementable ideas. In addition, it creates a comfortable environment where ideators trust the process.

In essence, it’s not engagement and ideas or engagement versus ideas. Instead, it’s quality engagement equals quality ideas.

How is this done? There are many different ways this can be achieved. For our program, we use a three-tier approach that works to extract complete ideas, create transparency and promote collaboration. All of this, in turn, helps to level-set overall expectations and nurture a culture of innovation.

## Extracting Ideas

When we started ignite! Innovation in 2011, we had an overly-simplistic submission process. We proposed a question or concern that needed addressing and followed the question with a one-field submission form with a comment section for overall collaboration.

That was it. Imagine the outcome.

We received hundreds and hundreds of ideas. Some good. Some bad. But most were just skeletons of solutions that were missing research, ROI, personal examples, etc. In addition, no expectations were set for the comment section. As a result, most threads consisted of white noise comments that provided little true feedback such as - ‘Great Idea!’ or ‘Terrific’. These kinds of comments add no real value.

In both cases, this ideation process lacked quality engagement. We didn’t help the ideators think through their idea. We didn’t help them identify the essential components of an idea such as ROI or needed resources. As a result, any ideator who wasn’t accustomed to proposing business ideas regardless of the complexity didn’t have any honest chance of having their idea truly vetted for success.

That’s tragic. Think of the great ideas that inevitably fell through the cracks because the ideator lacked the needed resources to fully articulate their idea. Simply put, this was not quality engagement.

> “We changed, however. Our program began to use human centered design techniques and business canvas model fields to refine our submission form. Instead of asking, ‘what is your idea?’, we asked several simple, yet thoughtful questions such as, ‘who has the problem and what, if anything, have they done to solve for it?’,” Morris stated.

These types of questions along with submission requests about ROI and real-world examples, helped the ideator think through their idea step-by-step. This allowed for evaluation of the idea before it was even submitted. This was quality engagement that resulted in quality ideation.

## Creating Transparency

Transparency during an innovation challenge is one of the most overlooked variables to quality engagement and ideation. Why? Reviewers and administrators don’t think about the non-winning ideators during an innovation challenge. They think about the winning ideas and ideators, which is certainly understandable. While this seems appropriate, neglecting the non-winning ideators can inhibit future innovation events both in terms of engagement and ideation.

This problem is straightforward. When innovators feel unvalued and believe no one is looking at and/or reviewing their ideas, they won’t re-engage. This is problematic as it shrinks the pool of innovators. Just because an ideator doesn’t have a great idea during one event, doesn’t mean they won’t have a great idea during another. However, if the ideator believes their ideas fall on deaf ears, they simply won’t submit.

This can be avoided with simple transparency during any event. For example, a confirmation email upon submission which lays next steps in the review process. Follow-up emails letting the ideator know if their idea has advanced or if their idea has been closed out and why. This type of communication strategy helps deliver quality engagement which, in turn, leads to future quality ideation.

## Promoting Collaboration

No idea should exist in a silo. No idea can exist in silo. Any great idea, as the saying goes, was built on the shoulders of previous great ideas. This is true even with the smallest of ideas. Open collaboration, comments, voting, creating teams, etc., cannot be downplayed when trying to create quality engagement. Every idea and ideator needs to be open to this type of initial collaboration.

However, such collaboration tends to lead to white noise if left unchecked.

Years ago, when we launched our first CEO Challenge, we received nearly twice as many comments as ideas. This should have been a good thing. It wasn’t. The vast majority of the comments submitted were what we called “white noise” comments. These were comments such as – “great idea”; “I like it”; “great job”; etc. They didn’t add any value or insight to the idea. They didn’t address any issues or concerns. They did give encouragement, to be sure, but not in any particular direction. As result, ideators weren’t inclined to enhance their idea, conduct further research and/or pivot and propose something different. Ideas were entered and went to the review round as-is.

Voting tends to fall into the same pattern. A simple ‘like’ or ‘thumbs up’ adds no real value or insight. This type of collaboration is also very biased, especially if used to advance ideas. Colleagues tend to vote for their colleagues. We received calls and emails from entire teams asking if they could vote for an idea multiple times in hopes of advancing it to the next round. Some ideators would send email blasts to their colleagues requesting them to vote for his/her idea.

What type of value was any of this adding? Not much, if any. Expectations need to set to start any innovation challenge. Comments need to be constructive and address specific points within an idea. Although this deters some comments, it adds to a better overall idea. Eliminating ‘like’ and ‘thumbs up’ altogether and including, if possible, other types of voting like pairwise comparisons helps reduce bias voting.

Put altogether, these tiers of solutions increase engagement while producing high quality ideas. Innovators feel valued. Collaborators offer real insight. Ideas are better equipped for implementation.
