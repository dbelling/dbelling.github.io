In a time where investors are calling for innovation, companies are turning to their closest stakeholder, their employees, to answer the call. Employees are happy to participate, and are excited by the chance to add value to the company.

Employees are happier in their careers when given the opportunity to contribute to their companies in a meaningful way. They become vested in the success of their employer, not only for a paycheck, but also [because they feel recognized](http://www.fastcompany.com/3004595/secrets-americas-happiest-companies).

During my time working with Optum, my colleagues eagerly anticipated our annual company-wide innovation challenge and brought their unbridled enthusiasm from the challenge to their daily workplace discussions. It was clear that an annual event helped to peak interest, but wasn’t enough to realize the full benefits of the creative thinking sparked by the one-time event. Innovation became an expectation, not only from the company, but also from its employees.

One popular practice that top companies have implemented is to provide employees with a set number of hours to work on an innovative new idea. This concept was engrained into the culture at Google ([known at Google as "20% time"](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/21/jobs/21pre.html?_r=0)),
but it’s also an expensive risk to take on capturing creativity. Baking “innovation time” into a company culture requires commitment and resources. Baking time into a culture for innovation is like jumping into the deep end while learning to swim. You certainly can take the plunge (and give employees time off to implement ideas), or you can safely wade in to foreign territory (and progressively get employees more involved with innovation).

We’ve found that low-impact innovation challenges are a safer alternative to dedicated innovation time. In idea challenges, employees share and collaborate on ideas via time-boxed submission periods. “20% time” worked at Google while Google was growing rapidly, but now as a more mature company, Google replaced their “20% time” with a focused innovation approach. This means business units are now spending closer to 100% of their time working on their core business activity. Using idea challenges works similarly to Google’s new focused approach, because employees can engage at their convenience, while not detracting from their primary roles. They can quickly and easily tap into the pulse of innovative new ideas, and feel connected and involved. The learning curve is low and the cost to participate is minimal compared to the opportunity cost of reducing productive work hours.

It is important that employees understand that challenges and innovation in general are not one-time events. Commitment to a program (however small), requires setting expectations and following-through. If your skilled innovators get inspired, they want to know that the company is serious with their ideas as well. They want to be recognized for their ideas and want to see ideas put into action. Companies that remove support or communication for innovation and ideation can cause confusion, exhaustion with the process, and potential unwillingness to participate in future requests for innovation.

Employees at Optum hear about innovation so often, that they instinctively understand the proper outlets for voicing ideas. We’ve used idea challenges as a way to build and sustain a grassroots ecosystem of innovation. Our ignite! idea challenges and programs deliver thousands of ideas per quarter, which have implementation rates as high as 10% annually. It works because people have come to expect it, and they believe in it.

Employees want to contribute. It makes them happy, and improves their opinion and perception of the innovative nature and livelihood of their company. They feel recognized and valuable. Employers need to create a consistent, reliable, and clear way for their employees to contribute and collaborate in order to reap the benefits of a happier workforce, and to further develop innovation as a core competency of the organization.
